I enjoy the discussions, but you don't have to label a hero or villain to everyone.

 Roy and Pam dated and they didn't have a strong connection to seal the deal. Roy has anger issues but not a villain, just framed as such. 

I think Pam and Jim have a genuine connection started out as friends and then it grew and grew. Then it turned into feelings,

Jim despite having feelings,  buried it and moved on to date two other chicks, dont know why yall have to frame it as Jim was never Pam's friend or he was stealing her the whole time.

Jim and Pam both tried to the right thing and they just couldn't help gravitating toward each other.

And this dig at Jim, probably was a slight dig or even just trying to be real about the situation despite being at the shit end of the stick.

And Jim can just have had a moment on insecurity, just like everybody else in the entire world.

Notice that after Pam and Roy broke up, Pam was able to come out of her cocoon and spread her wings. Same thing with Roy. Pam was holding him back. He always looked like a dead beat who was the typical High school jock who never grew up. That was because of Pam. 

Just like how Roy squashed Pam's dreams of being an artist. They were not good together. Once they broke up, both were able to grow as people.

So between their intense connection, how much Michael grew in that time, and then them dating other people that were clearly not right for them, it made engagement a quicker easy decision. 

Think about the convo Michael had with Holly when they were broken up, about how he was able to look back on his past relationships and still feel theirs was solid, compared to his other clusterfks. 

Holly and Michael also both clearly wanted kids and were antsy to get married.

Which is why it always annoys me when the office placates him. For example when Oscar gets outed he doesn't back down and the result is Michael going through positive growth. Or when Michael is part of the affair the entire office tells him he's being garbage without letting up and the episode ends with him doing the right thing. Alternatively you have the whole Stamford merger where he humiliates Tony then spends an entire episode being a racist attention seeking brat but nobody makes the slightest attempt to put his feet to the fire so he learns absolutely nothing. I mean Michael is an adult so I get that no is obligated and they shouldn't have to do this stuff but on the other hand it's so clear he will NEVER fire any of you so what the hell are you all so afraid of all the time? Like why walk on eggshells when you could straight up say ""Michael your being racist and sexist, knock it off or leave me alone""?

Like I love the show but personally one of the things I struggle with is the weird middle ground it exists in between shows like Seinfeld or Always Sunny in Philadelphia and shows like P&R or The Good Place. Always Sunny is bad people doing bad things and, aside from Mac Finds His Pride, there's never a moment you're supposed root for or feel bad for the characters. Alternatively you have P&R, the characters have flaws but I rarely if ever find myself thinking ""why?"" when it comes to conflicts and character arcs because the writers usually address it. 

Like my go to example is Chris confronting Ron about the way he's running the department. We still got Ron being Ron and going forward he will still continue being Ron but the conflict in that arc is resolved by a friend confronting another friend because Ron was screwing up and Chris is both his friend and his boss. Whereas with the office I find the way characters play hopscotch with the line between friendship and total asshole to be a little jarring. Like Jims ""best boss I've ever had"" line would've hit harder to me if we didn't have 7 seasons of Michael making Jim visibly annoyed and upset more often than he makes him happy.
